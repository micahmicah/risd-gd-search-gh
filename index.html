        <p>The Department of Graphic Design in the Division of Architecture and Design invites applications for a full-time faculty appointment, to teach both undergraduate and graduate students, at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. Position commences Fall 2019.</p>

        <p>Rhode Island School of Design recognizes diversity and inclusivity as fundamental to its learning community and integral to an art and design education. We welcome candidates whose experience in teaching, scholarship, and/or service has prepared them to contribute to our commitment to diversity and excellence.</p>

        <p>The ideal candidate will be a practicing graphic designer and educator who is as passionate about teaching as they are about the field itself. We seek someone with demonstrated expertise in contemporary critical discourse, typography, and an experimental and innovative design practice and pedagogy. In addition to a successful teaching record at undergraduate and/or graduate levels, we seek candidates with a clear research agenda or design practice that complements and contributes to the departmental mission to offer a wide range of approaches and modalities in graphic design. Curated exhibitions, symposia, talks, writing, and/or published work will be considered as evidence of professional status.</p>

        <p>As we strive to develop a faculty that better reflects the broad range of student communities at RISD, we seek candidates with a pedagogy that attends to student diversity in the studio classroom and a record of inclusive teaching practices. Candidates with direct experience working with historically marginalized groups and perspectives are especially encouraged to apply.</p>

        <p>Our new colleague will bring their research and practice into a rich team-teaching environment, with an emphasis on sharing and student/teacher empowerment. Excellent interpersonal skills, clarity, generosity, and creativity in both personal work and teaching are essential. Leadership opportunities, as they become available, will offer another way for new faculty to help shape the future of our department.</p>

        <p>In addition to the qualifications listed above, applicants for the Associate level position should have 5 or more years experience teaching design studios and seminars. Successful applicants for the Associate level position should also have significant experience developing curriculum, managing faculty and students, and engaging in the daily administrative tasks associated with overseeing a department. The department head position rotates every few years, and candidates for the Associate level position should be prepared to step into the headship position within the first few years of being at RISD.</p>
