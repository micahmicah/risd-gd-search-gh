    <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7 col-lg-6">
           <p> Rhode Island School of Design recognizes diversity and inclusivity as fundamental to its learning community and integral to an art and design education. We welcome candidates whose experiences in teaching, creative practice/scholarship, professional practice, service, and personal experience have prepared them to contribute to our commitment to diversity and excellence. </p>

        <p>The Department of Graphic Design (GD) in the Division of Architecture + Design invites applications for a full-time faculty appointment, to teach both undergraduate and graduate students, at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. Position commences fall 2016. </p>

        <p>With 11 full-time faculty positions, and 30 part-time faculty, the Graphic Design Department runs 110 classes a year for approximately 200 BFA candidates, 40 MFA candidates, and a small number of non-major and Brown University students. </p>

        <p>RISD aims to graduate broad-minded, independent and visually articulate thinkers and makers. In the Graphic Design Department, we are committed to educating the whole person, with design as the primary means of research, expression and exploration. Our graduates (graduate and undergraduate) become both professional and academic leaders in graphic design and are equipped to develop their own practices or to work in larger collaborative settings, creating and participating in local, national, and international contexts. </p>

        <p>Our undergraduate curriculum is designed to thrive upon both junior and senior faculty interests, and our graduate program seeks faculty who model critical practice and theory, and who may contribute to graduate-level teaching and thesis advising. In our Graphic Design Department, inquiry leads formal outcome, with students and faculty alike working across media to investigate how design operates as an essential social and cultural language.</p>

    <h3 class="col-xs-12 col-sm-2 col-sm-offset-1 ">Qualifications</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7 col-lg-6">
            <p>    The ideal candidate will be a committed practicing designer and educator who is as passionate about teaching as she or he is about the field itself. As graphic design evolves, so must educators and practitioners, and as such, we seek a colleague who is both engaged in and energized by this developing and shifting dynamic. Candidates should be elastic thinkers and active makers engaged in a combination of professional practice, research, and innovation in the classroom. They should be interested in joining a highly motivated community of students and faculty in a department that values tradition while at the same time explores the boundaries of design theory and practice. </p>

            <p>Known for its rigorous program and talented students, RISD GD recently rolled out a new undergraduate core sequence that encourages deeper inquiry and challenges students to experiment with what graphic design is and what it can become. A new colleague would play a pivotal role in this core sequence and would advise and teach both undergraduate and graduate students in 2D, 3D, and multimedia design, as well as in the more speculative edges of the field. Our Department is committed to engaging in and shaping the discourse emerging from our shifting design landscape-where the very nature of communication technology, social dynamics, and networked communities is about flux- and where change is the norm and fluidity essential.</p>

            <p>A graduate degree in graphic design, visual communication, or closely and demonstrably related study and a minimum 2-3 years of teaching experience is preferred (or equivalent combination of applicable academic and professional experience). Ideal candidates will exhibit the capacity to advise and teach both undergraduate and graduate students, contribute to the workings of the Department and the College, and be committed to eventual rotation in and out of leadership positions in coming years.</p>
